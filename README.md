# BCG-Data-Science-Job-Simulation
Welcome to the Data Science program! BCG X is transforming the businesses of today through data science and advanced analytics initiatives and our goal is to help companies generate competitive advantage through these initiatives. This module is designed to give you a feel of what it is like to work at BCG X as we help our clients using data science.

As a BCG X Data Scientist, you can expect to work in many different industries, and on many different types of business challenges. The skills you will use and develop today are part of the consultant and data scientist toolkits, and will be applicable to many different types of cases.

We hope you will enjoy your virtual experience and get a glimpse into the exciting life of a Data Scientist at BCG X!

#Here is your task_1
Your first task today is to understand what is going on with the client and to think about how you would approach this problem and test the specific hypothesis.

You must formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email to your AD, focusing on the data that you would need from the client and the analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.

We would suggest spending no more than one hour on this task.

Please note, there are multiple ways to approach the task and that the model answer is just one way to do it.

If you are stuck: 

Remember what the key factors are for a customer deciding to stay with or switch providers
Think of data sources and fields that could be used to explore the contribution of various factors to a customer’s possible action 
Ideally, what would a data frame of your choice look like – what should each column and row represent? 
What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more insights about the customer's churn behavior? 

Estimated time for task completion: 1 hour depending on your learning style. 

#Here is your task_2
Sub-Task 1:

Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions. This first subtask is for you to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset. You should spend around 1 hour on this.

Sub-Task 2:

Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn. It is up to you to define price sensitivity and calculate it. You should spend around 30 minutes on this.


Sub-Task 3:

Prepare a half-page summary or slide of key findings and add some suggestions for data augmentation – which other sources of data should the client provide you with and which open source datasets might be useful? You should spend 10-15 minutes on this.

For your final deliverable, please submit your analysis (in the form of a jupyter notebook, code script or PDF) as well as your half-page summary document.

Note: Use the 2 datasets within the additional resources for this task and if you’re unsure on where to start with visualizing data, use the accompanying links. Be sure to also use the data description document to understand what the columns represent. The task description document outlines the higher-level motivation of the project. Finally, use the eda_starter.ipynb file to get started with some helper functions and methods.

If you are stuck: Think about ways you can define price sensitivity. Make sure to think of all possible ways and investigate them.
