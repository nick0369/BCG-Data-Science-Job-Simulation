Subject: Hypothesis and Approach for Churn Prediction and Discounting Strategy
Dear [AD's Name],
I hope this email finds you well. I have taken some time to analyze the client's situation regarding
the churn problem and their interest in trying a discounting strategy. After careful consideration,
I've formulated a hypothesis as a data science problem and outlined the major steps to test this
hypothesis.
Hypothesis: Churn among SME customers is driven by customer price sensitivity. Offering
customers with a high propensity to churn a 20% discount will be an effective strategy to reduce
churn.
Approach and Steps:
1. Data Collection:
• Obtain historical customer data from the client, including customer profiles, billing
information, usage patterns, and churn history.
• We will need data for both customers who churned (churners) and those who did not
(non-churners) to build and validate the predictive model.
2. Data Preprocessing:
• Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and outliers.
• Create features that can help in assessing price sensitivity, such as historical billing,
contract type, and usage data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Conduct EDA to understand the relationship between price sensitivity, churn, and
other factors.
• Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices can reveal
patterns.
4. Feature Selection:
• Identify relevant features through correlation analysis and statistical tests.
• Price sensitivity indicators should be prominent among selected features.
5. Model Development:
• Build a predictive model for customer churn. We can use various machine learning
algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient
boosting.
6. Model Evaluation:
• Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1-score.
• Conduct cross-validation to ensure model stability.
7. Model Interpretation:• Interpret the model's output to understand the importance of features, especially
those related to price sensitivity.
8. Discount Strategy Simulation:
• Identify customers with a high propensity to churn based on the model's predictions.
• Simulate the impact of offering a 20% discount to these customers.
9. Measure the Impact:
• Monitor churn rates after implementing the discount strategy.
• Compare the churn rates with historical data to measure the strategy's effectiveness.
10.Recommendations:
• Present the findings to the client and provide recommendations for implementing the
discounting strategy effectively.
Data Frame Structure: A suitable data frame should include columns such as customer ID,
features related to customer profiles, billing information, historical usage, churn status, and a churn
prediction score generated by the model.
In summary, we will analyze historical data to build a predictive model that identifies customers at
high risk of churning, primarily due to price sensitivity. Offering these customers a 20% discount
will be tested to measure its impact on reducing churn. The key outcomes will guide the client's
discounting strategy.
Please let me know your thoughts, and I am ready to proceed once we have access to the necessary
data.
Best regards,
